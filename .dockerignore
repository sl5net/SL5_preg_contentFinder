# Exclude specific file extensions
*.sh

# It's also common to exclude the vendor directory if you run `composer install` INSIDE the container
# vendor/

# Other common exclusions (add as needed)
.git/
.gitignore
Dockerfile
.dockerignore
# node_modules/
# logs/  (unless you explicitly want to copy pre-existing logs)
# tempResult.txt (if this is truly temporary)
# BACKUPtests/ (if these are just backups and not needed in the image)
# tests/ (if you don't run tests inside this specific final image)
# examples/
